# DevOps


## Continuous integration (CI): is the practice in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day (wikipedia).

## Continuous delivery (CD): is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. (wikipedia)


- Verify and publish work by trigger automated builds and tests.
- Developers push their changes to a version control like GIT, which should then be built and tested, which can be done with jenkins.

- Jenkins does not resolve merge conflicts.

## System development life cycle (SDLC)

Developer -> Build [Compile] -> Test [Unit test, integration test, regression test]-> Realease [Package]
